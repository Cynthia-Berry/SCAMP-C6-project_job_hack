# API Application

SheCodes-Africa Project - API Infrastructure to handle clients search for a job that is relevant to their domain or area of interest.

## Available Scripts

Run `node app.js` or `npm run dev` ( that is,`nodemon`) for a dev server. Navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

Important Note:
The app will automatically reload if you run `nodemon` or `npm run dev` (I have configured this command to help run nodemon as my development server) when you change any of the source files.

The application won't automatically reload if you run `node app.js`, so, ensure to stop the application using `ctrl + c` then re-run `node app.js`

## Controlling the job search project
1. Want to quit your running Node.js server?
You can always do that by pressing `ctrl + c` in the terminal/command prompt window where you started your server (i.e. where you ran `npm run dev` or `nodemon`).

2. Create a .env file and make reference to your database information for the below stated constants, so you can run this project seamlessly and test the endpoints.

`PORT=5000`

`MONGODB_USERNAME=***************`

`MONGODB_PASSWORD=***************`

`MONGODB_CLUSTER_SUFFIX=@cluster******************`

`TOKEN_KEY=randomStrings`

NB: The asteriks values are to be supplied by you in relation to your MongoDB Atlas set up in your local machine.

3. To successfully make a request on secured endpoints use 

`JWT ey****************`

to set your JWT header before making a request on postman or any other API testing platform.
   (This is exclusive of the registration and login endpoints).
4. This application is hosted on 
   1. [RENDER](https://job-hack.onrender.com) 
   
   any of the above can be used as the applications BASEURL instead of running the application locally
